* Introduced to perf_counter() function that computes elapsed time for a given process or function
 
* Introduced to str.count() method 

* Enhanced the performance and reduced elapsed time running the program

* Introduced to parametrize testcases with implementation

* The best practice for each test case to handle just one funcitonality, as for loop in test case is not recommended

* The ability to catch multiple exceptions using a single except clause

* Not necessarily to pass each attribute as a parameter in the constructor method
